Jobsworth Documentation (jwdoc)
===============================

Welcome to the Jobsworth Project Management Documentation.
The associated Jobsworth software development project will be found here:

[Project page]             http://github.com/ari/jobsworth

I hope, this collection of information will grow the user community of
Jobsworth Project Management software.
Please contribute with anything you think is useful here. Especially
the many screenshots need some good descriptions first.

And for those of you already working with Jobsworth for a while: Why not contribute
a kind of typical workflow snippets?

Have fun and I wish, this is somehow useful for some of you!
