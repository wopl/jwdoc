  <title>Installation</title>
  <abstract>
   <para>The base installation of Jobsworth 4.0 is very easy
        (big improvement to previous releases), once a server with
        some SQL-database and a servlet container has been set up. For
        those of you not setting up such servers frequently, I have
        added some more screenshots and commands, that might help you
        speeding up the installation process.</para>
  </abstract>
  <note>
   <para>
       The following installation instructions are based on FreeBSD&reg; 9.2.
       Other Unix-like operating systems may also work, once a LAMP server has been set up.
       Especially pathes to configuration files differ in various distributions
       from FreeBSD&reg; and have to be adapted individually.
     </para>
  </note>
    <para>
    First of all get an operating system on a dedicated machine running. Typically Jobsworth
    only uses server functionality, therefore a graphical user interface (e.g. Gnome or KDE) is
    not necessary. If you are new to server installation, such GUI would help you to find your
    way around (e.g. looking on the web for HowTo's). 
    </para>
  <section id="database">
   <title>Database</title>
     <para>
     Install the database-server package. You can either use mysql or
     postgresql. The following example shows the setup of
     <emphasis>mysql</emphasis>
     . After invoking mysql from the command-line you should see a screen like this:

      <para>
       If you see any minus-signs in the screenshot above: This is some unresolved
       rendering error problem (for PDFs only?). Be aware that those minus-signs
       shall NOT be typed as part of the configuration scripts that will follow.
      </para>

     <para>Now type in the following commands to create the jobsworth database and 
     an admin-user. Feel free to adjust database-name, user-id and password and
     note it for later configuration. Then quit mysql-console.</para>
     <screen><userinput>CREATE DATABASE mydb DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8</userinput>
<userinput>CREATE USER &apos;monty&apos;@&apos;localhost&apos; IDENTIFIED BY &apos;some_pass&apos;;</userinput>
<userinput>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'monty'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION</userinput>
<userinput>quit</userinput></screen>
     <note>
      <para>
       At a later stage in this installation process Jobsworth will setup all tables
       and initial data on its first call.

      To enable the start of mysql during start of your server, the following entry has
      to be inserted into your startup configuration file (e.g. /etc/rc.conf)
